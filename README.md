# Palette Picker

Palette Picker is an application that is built in two stages. There is a back end located [here](https://github.com/N-Gibson/back-end-palette-picker) and the front end app deployed on [heroku](https://pp-fe.herokuapp.com/). The purpose of this application is to create a user interface in which they can add projects and color palettes to those projects. The user can lock in colors they like created by our random generator where they can later be saved. 

## Tech

The tech used to create this application includes:
  - Node.js
  - React.js
  - Jest
  - Enzyme
  - React Router
  - GitHub Projects [front end](https://github.com/N-Gibson/front-end-palette-picker/projects/1) & [back end](https://github.com/N-Gibson/back-end-palette-picker/projects/1)
  - [Invision Studio](https://projects.invisionapp.com/prototype/paletee-picker-ck3t70djb000z1w01v6x0qy8h/play/fa9c7c88)
  
### Setup
  
Both the front and back ends are deployed publically, however if you wish to clone the repos and use them locally, the front end can be cloned [here](https://github.com/N-Gibson/front-end-palette-picker) and the back end can be cloned [here](https://github.com/N-Gibson/back-end-palette-picker).
  
You will need Postgress for the server build.

Once you have cloned the repos, `cd` into them and run `npm install` to install the dependencies.

From there run `nodemon server.js` to start the servers on the backend.

Finally run `npm start` to start the front end. 

The app can be located at http://localhost:3000
